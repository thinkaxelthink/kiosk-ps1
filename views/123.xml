  <Say>Let's open cans and bottles with joyful design pleasure of nostalgic wonderment, shan't we? The G-A-N-G-Y is red and oh-so-romantic. Would you be mine, sweetheart? You have no idea what I can cook with a couple of cans and a few good bottles. This is what you want if you only possess one cooking tool in your kitchen, although I am not sure why this would be the case. Cooking is an easy 1,2,3 with the G-A-N-G-Y.</Say>
