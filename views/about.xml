<Say>KIOSK is: a travel story depicted through objects, a collection of things that interest us,
  a study in material culture, a shop, several people's efforts to preserve uniqueness in the world,
  an installation of sorts. Hopefully what we share encourages you to go out and meet and talk and
  learn and see and show. You don't have to travel far; look up, down and around... When you open
  your eyes fascination is everywhere.</Say>
