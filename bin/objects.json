You have no idea what I can cook with a couple of cans and a few good bottles. This is what you want if you only possess one cooking tool in your kitchen, although I am not sure why this would be the case. Cooking is an easy 1,2,3 with the G-A-N-G-Y."

		"description": "The Vredenbregt house in Rotterdam must have one of these. Note! the felt insulation that wraps around the ceramic pot which sits inside the metal holder. Wait, wait. The ceramic pot sits inside the metal holder, which is lined in wool felt to keep the ceramic pot, and therefore the tea, warm? CONFUSED? I AM TOO. But, I'm dazzled. Comes in two sizes- the large is better for long, rainy day conversations and the small for a quick morning fix."
